/// // UI -> create ChangeNotifierProvider widget that wraps this provider

/// 
/// // UI -> Subscribe to the provider
/// Consumer<ActivityExploreProvider>(
///   builder: (context, provider, child) {
///     // here you can be notified when the provider state changed
///     // you can for example build widget acconrdingly by using a switch case
///     // statement
