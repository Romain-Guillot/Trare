/// The [activities] list is null if the activities are not yet loaded or if an

/// When the [ActivityUserProvider] is created, its state is

/// // UI -> create ChangeNotifierProvider widget that wraps this provider
/// ChangeNotifierProvider<ActivityUserProvider>(create: (context) =>
///   ActivityUserProvider(
///     activityService: ..., 
///     profileService: ...,
///   )..loadActivities()
/// ),
/// 
/// 
/// // UI -> Subscribe to the provider
/// Consumer<ActivityUserProvider>(
///   builder: (context, provider, child) {
///     // here you can be notified when the provider state changed
///     // you can for example build widget acconrdingly by using a switch case
///     // statement
///   }
