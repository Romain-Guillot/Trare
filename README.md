# Trare

## Contributing process
- Make sure to read the contributing guide: [`CONTIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Assign yourself an issue or create a new one. Each question of the current sprint is listed in the corresponding [Github Project](https://github.com/Romain-Guillot/Trare/projects) (Kanban board)
- Move your issue in the **WIP** column and resolve your issue
- When you're done, comment the issue with the commit reference ([guide how to](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/autolinked-references-and-urls#commit-shas))
- Close the issue and move it in the **Done** column

**Preferably resolve one issue per commit.** It's easier for code review.

## Next features
- List of the activities created by the user
- Add photo to the user profile
- System for connecting users (activity chats, "I'm interested" button)
- Ability to change the activity search parameters (radius, position)
